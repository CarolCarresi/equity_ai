Larry.\\nAs a preliminary note, I would like to point out that some of the material we will be discussing today may include forward-looking statements regarding our business and expected financial results.\\nWhen we use words like anticipate, believe, estimate or expect, these are generally forward-looking statements.\\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, they are based on information currently available to us and certain assumptions made by us, and we cannot assure you that they will prove correct.\\nYou should also read our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements.\\nLooking at the P&L.\\nConsolidated net sales in Q1 '17 were $282.4 million, up $43.5 million or 18.2%.\\nThis significant increase is primarily related to 2 factors: first, $23.4 million wire sales from our general cable acquisition, completed at the end of May 2016.\\nExcluding the GC volume, our consolidated net sales increased 8.4%.\\nThe second significant increase was from stronger preseason Temp Control orders, following the warm 2016 season.\\nBy segment, Engine Management net sales in Q1 '17 were $211.3 million, up $30.6 million or 17%.\\nExcluding the GC wire acquisition incremental sales, Engine Management sales were up $7.2 million or 4%.\\nThis increase reflects higher pipeline orders from certain customers as they are increasing their inventory coverage.\\nTemp Control net sales in Q1 '17 were $70.3 million, up $13.5 million or 23.8%.\\nThis significant percentage increase reflects the higher preseason orders in anticipation of another warm season as experienced in 2016.\\nConsolidated gross margin dollars in Q1 were up $11.1 million at 29.8%, down 0.8 points.\\nLooking at the margins by segment, Engine Management gross margin was 30.3%, down 1.4 points versus Q1 '16.\\nMargins were off slightly related to lower margins in our GC wire acquisition sales not present last year.\\nWe expect the GC margins to improve significantly once we have combined the acquired operations in Nogales, Mexico, into our existing Reynosa, Mexico, operation.\\nIn addition, we are incurring additional costs during our multiple transition moves.\\nTemp Control gross margin was 25.2%, up 0.4 points versus Q1 '16.\\nMargins benefited from higher production levels and our continued efforts and focus on reducing costs.\\nTotal SG&A expenses were $57.4 million in Q1 at 20.3% of net sales versus 22.2% last year.\\nThe GC wire acquisition was beneficial, gaining leverage on our SG&A spend as we have integrated our wire sales, marketing and distribution functions during 2016.\\nThe SG&A percentage also benefited from the higher Temp Control preseason orders shipped.\\nConsolidated operating income before restructuring and integration expenses and other income net in Q1 '17 was $26.8 million, 9.5% of net sales versus $20 million, 8.4% of net sales last year, reflecting a 1.1 point improvement.\\nOperating income dollars were up in both segments, and our restructuring initiatives underway should improve this performance further.\\nThe net effect of our operational results as reported on our non-GAAP reconciliation was Q1 '17 diluted earnings per share of $0.74 versus $0.55 last year, which is almost a 35% increase.\\nLooking at the balance sheet.\\nOur working capital needs increased as we entered the spring and summer seasons.\\nAR increased $45.5 million since December '16, primarily with the strong Temp Control preseason orders.\\nInventories increased $19.3 million since December as we build inventories for the summer season and also bridge inventory builds, with our multiple facility moves underway.\\nAccounts payable increased $18.1 million, partially offsetting the rise in receivables and inventories.\\nTotal debt increased $27.2 million to fund our working capital needs.\\nThese working capital increases are expected as we enter Q1 and Q2.\\nAnd then we begin to monetize these investments through Q3 and Q4.\\nOur cash flow statement reflects a $27 million use of cash in Q1 '17 versus only $1 million use last year.\\nThis increase reflects the higher working capital needs, slightly offset by higher net earnings.\\nCapital expenditures were $3.2 million, slightly below the $4 million level in Q1 '16.\\nWe anticipate this spend level to increase over the balance of the year to the $25 million-plus range for the full year compared to $21 million in 2016.\\nThis reflects our continued focus to reinvest in our businesses.\\nIn February 2017, we announced a $20 million Board of Directors authorized repurchase program for our common stock.\\nIn Q1 '17, we repurchased 32,367 shares at a cost of $1.6 million or $48.18 a share.\\nIn Q2 '17, through the end of April, we repurchased another 30,543 shares at a cost of roughly $1.5 million or $48.09 a share, leaving us a remaining $17 million authorization for future repurchases.\\nIn summary, we are pleased with the results in the quarter and future initiatives to strengthen our business for the long-term.\\nThank you for your attention, and I will turn the call over to <UNK>.\\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody.\\nJim has covered the numbers, and as you've heard, we're quite pleased.\\nSales were obviously quite strong.\\nHowever, it is important to note that in both of our divisions, a portion of the sales was geared towards customer pipelines rather than strong demand through the channel.\\nAs you've seen from first quarter earnings calls from our large publicly traded customers, Q1 was a bit of a challenge overall, and we did see that to varying degrees with how they did with our product lines as well.\\nI'll talk about the 2 divisions separately.\\nIn Engine Management, our customers' POS was slightly down.\\nMeanwhile, their purchases from us were up fairly substantially.\\nIf you exclude the acquired General Cable business, our Engine Management sales out were about 4% up.\\nFew of our customers determined the need to expand their assortment and deployed broader inventories throughout their system.\\nThey, therefore, placed heavier-than-normal line update orders as they reset their planograms.\\nAs you know, a key to growth in the DIFM business is to have broad coverage and rapid delivery.\\nSo working with our category management team, they identified coverage gaps and sought to fill those gaps.\\nIn Temp Control, our customers did post slight increases in POS, but the dollars are small as Q1 is always a light quarter.\\nAs a weather-related business, our first quarter is almost entirely about preseason orders as our customers get ready for the summer.\\nWe see this every year, but this year, the preseason orders have come in heavier, which reflects the impact of last year's hot summer, where they ended the season a bit lighter on inventory than usual.\\nSo we, therefore, believe that the customer actions within both divisions do bode well for the future as we believe that these strategic purchasing decisions will help them secure sales going forward.\\nBut as we always reiterate, one should look at our performance year-over-year, as quarterly activities can cause some temporary peaks and valleys.\\nSo I won't spend any more time on the numbers.\\nI thought I'd spend a few minutes talking about recent initiatives, and then we'll open it up for Q&A.\\nFirst, an update on General Cable.\\nWe're nearing the anniversary of this acquisition, and other than planned integration and efficiencies, it's performing quite well.\\nSales have been solid, and we've retained all the accounts.\\nWe've greatly improved our shipping performance, our fill rates across the board to all of these accounts, and the acquired plant in Nogales is doing really quite well.\\nThe integration is proceeding on plan as announced, the distribution all moved last year, and we have now moved the manufacturing for several accounts without any hiccups.\\nWe're on target with the build-out of an additional 75,000 square feet in our Reynosa wire plant to accommodate the balance of the production lines, which will all be moved by the end of the first quarter of next year.\\nSo overall, within wire and cable, 2017 will remain a transition year, with lots of moving pieces.\\nAnd while we fully expect to achieve all of the planned synergies, we won't be all the way there with our profit improvement until next year.\\nWe've also been quite active with other plant moves.\\nWe're making strides in winding down our Grapevine, Texas, plant, a project we've been working on since early of last year.\\nTo remind you, there were 2 elements in Grapevine, where we did all of our diesel products as well as a bunch of our Temperature Control.\\nAll of the diesel lines have now moved to our injector plant in Greenville, South Carolina, and are performing really quite well.\\nGreenville is our center of excellence for fuel delivery products, and we're excited to see what they're going to be able to do with this line.\\nThe Temp Control products are all slated to move to Reynosa.\\nWe've expanded into an additional building there, which is now fully up and running.\\nWe've moved several of the lines already and have a handful of lines left to go.\\nWe're on target to be out of Grapevine by the end of the year, and we're actively marketing the building and the [product].\\nWe are very pleased to note that many of the Grapevine employees have elected to take other jobs with us, mostly at our Louisville location close by, but also in South Carolina, and we're very excited that they've chosen to stay with us.\\nAs discussed on our last earnings call, we are now also in the process of closing our electronics plant in Orlando and relocating it to Independence, Kansas.\\nTo remind you of the rationale, Orlando is an excellent high-tech plant, but quite small, less than 50 people and only about 50,000 square feet.\\nAnd meanwhile, Independence is quite large and diverse and manufactures many other similar electronic products, and they can easily absorb all the Orlando production and allow us to be a much more effective manufacturer seeking synergies between the 2 operations.\\nThis will be a multi-phased move, which will take us into the middle of next year to complete.\\nThe first phase will soon be underway, and everything is on schedule.\\nSo for all of our employees in both Grapevine and Orlando, we really would like to thank you publicly.\\nYou've been terrific throughout this entire process.\\nIt's been a difficult time, but you've continued to operate your plans with pride, performed at a high level and are helping to make this successful.\\nSo you do truly have our sincere gratitude.\\nSo in closing, we are very pleased with the quarter.\\nWe have a great team here at Standard, and with their talents, I and the rest of the senior management team here at Standard, we're very excited about our future.\\nSo with that, I will turn it back over to the moderator, and we will open it up for questions.\\nCan you maybe just talk about sell-in.\\n<UNK>, you talked about how your customers are talking about how things were a little sluggish in the quarter.\\nMaybe just talk a little bit more about what they're saying, what they're hearing, whether it's weather related or just timing or tough comparisons with a year ago.\\nAnd maybe just talk about -- maybe just reaffirm your expectations for the segment if you could.\\nThe quarter -- different customers had slightly different experiences in the quarter with the 2 different product lines.\\nAnd -- but I don't think it's anything that has any longer-term impacts.\\nOverall, we see our Engine Management business is going to increase barring any major gains or losses of business.\\nIt's going to roll with the trends of the overall market, up a couple of percentage points year-over-year.\\nTemp Control is entirely based on the summer.\\nAnd so here we are in early May.\\nWe'll see what the next few months bring.\\nBut we don't get too hung up in what happened in a particular quarter.\\nAnd we'll just see what happens as the year progresses.\\nGot it.\\nAnd on the margin side, a couple of items.\\nYou talked about General Cable mixing in and some of the redundancies with the facility moves.\\nCan you maybe just -- it sounds as if the lion's share of the contraction came from the latter.\\nCan you maybe just confirm that, maybe just talk about that a little bit.\\nYes, <UNK>.\\nThis is Jim <UNK>.\\nSo again, part of the -- on the General Cable, the volume there -- when we took it over, the margins were lower and fully anticipated to bring them up once we consolidated the businesses.\\nThey have a higher mix of OE/OES business that's in there, which margins will be different than our aftermarket, but then we have lower SG&A.\\nWe are incurring incremental costs as you start up in a new area and wind down in the other.\\nAnd really, there's a lot of moving parts.\\nThe key is we expect these margins to improve to the Engine Management levels, and you'll see further improvements once we complete all the moves by the end of Q1 '18.\\nGot it.\\nAnd maybe on the SG&A line.\\nYou definitely had some nice advances in leverage.\\nSome of the things you talked about with General Cable and some of the consolidations there.\\nBut maybe just give us a framework of where you see in absolute dollar terms the line item going, I guess, for the balance of the year on a quarterly basis.\\nYes.\\nWe came in at $57 million for the quarter.\\nAnd Q2 and Q3, because of our sales volumes will pick up, that's in there.\\nSo again, that's probably the low end of the number that we would be in.\\nAnd again, I've talked consistently that we're more in absolute dollars than as a percent when you're looking at our spend.\\nSo from the $57 million, we would size up, obviously, in Q2 and Q3.\\nAnd then Q4, it really depends how much volume, but we're probably in that same range again there.\\nSo I would say the low point per quarter is $57 million.\\nWe size up a little bit in Q2 and 3.\\nGot it.\\nAnd one just last question maybe on new products.\\nI know that you guys have a lot of things in the pipeline and you've talked about numerous times.\\nMaybe just talk about whether it's diesel injectors or some of the new technologies in cars today that are leading to increased uses of your parts.\\nMaybe just give us an idea of how that's going.\\nSure, absolutely, <UNK>.\\nWell, yes, we do always have several new product lines that we are adding and growing with.\\nIt's important to note that a lot of times, any sales growth that we see on newer categories is really replacing older technology as it's falling off the backside of its life cycle.\\nBut we do have several going on right now.\\nOne that we've been talking about a bunch recently is diesel where, if you go back a couple of years, 2015, we really used that to get our house in order; 2016, we started to see the fruits of that; and here, first quarter of 2017, we're continuing to see sales in our overall diesel offering up in north of 20% growth year-over-year.\\nSo diesel is a really exciting category for us, and we see a lot of upside there, continuing to see growth in our TechSmart offering.\\nOne new thing that maybe I'll highlight just briefly is, we developed several years ago a compressed natural gas injector for heavy-duty markets, and really, it was -- we had the product, and we're waiting for the market to develop.\\nHere in early 2017, we are starting to see a nice uptick as the China market starts to adopt the technology a little bit better.\\nYes, it's a small piece of what we do, but just another example of where we're always looking for complementary product categories.\\nWithin -- I don't have the month-over-month numbers.\\nBut within the quarter, like I said, Engine Management was slightly soft, Temperature Control was okay.\\nIt's really a little too early to tell what's happening in this quarter, especially Engine Management, not particularly a weather-related product line.\\nAnd Temperature Control, as we've said numerous times, we really have to wait and see what happens going forward.\\nI believe that they started out this year a bit lighter than they started out last year, which is reflecting the fact that not only was last summer hot, but it stayed hot long.\\nSo what typically happens is, towards the end of a season, they will stop reordering from us and sell [them] from their own shelves.\\nAnd that is what we saw happen in 2016.\\nSo I believe that what we saw this year is, they started out lighter than they started '16, and now they are probably equally positioned for the season as they were last year.\\nYes.\\nAgain, Jim <UNK>.\\nIt'll be more gradual that's in there.\\nWe'll see some improvements coming over the second half of the year that we would see there and then the balance.\\nIt won't be a full step item that's in there, <UNK>.\\nAll right.\\nGoodbye.\\nThank you.\\n\",\n          \"Thank you, Jodi.\\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for the first-quarter 2016 earnings conference call for Belmond Ltd.\\nWe issued our earnings release last night.\\nThe release is available on our investor relations website at investor.\\nbelmond.com as well as on the SEC website.\\nOn the call with me today are <UNK> <UNK>, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Martin O'Grady, Chief Financial Officer.\\nBefore we get started today, I would like to read out our usual cautionary statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 in the United States.\\nIn the course of remarks to you today by Belmond's management and in answering your questions, they may make forward-looking statements concerning Belmond such as earnings outlook, future investment plans and other matters that are not historic facts.\\nWe caution that actual results of Belmond may differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\\nInformation about factors that could cause actual results to differ is set out in yesterday's news release, the Company's latest annual report to shareholders and the filings of the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nI will now hand the call over to <UNK>.\\nThank you, <UNK>, and good morning everyone.\\nBefore getting started, I first would like to mention that we will be hosting an investors and analysts meeting in New York City on June 1st, which we will also be live webcasting.\\nWe all look forward to providing more details around the execution of our strategic plan along with metrics and financial roadmap for our growth.\\nI remain, from my side, fully committed to maintaining an ongoing and transparent dialogue with our investors and the analysts and I see our June event as a fantastic opportunity to engage with many of you again.\\nAnd we hope that you will join us on June 1st, either in person or, if not, via webcast.\\nTurning then to the agenda for today's call, I will provide you first with an update on the recent progress that we have made on our strategic growth priorities.\\nMartin will then give you an overview of our first-quarter results and take you through the second-quarter and the full-year RevPAR guidance, which we provided in our earnings release last night.\\nAs you will have noted from our release, we have maintained our full-year 2016 RevPAR guidance at 3% to 7% growth.\\nWith our investor meeting taking place in only a few weeks' time from now, I will keep my remarks today short and brief.\\nOur goal has been, and remains, to execute more aggressively on our strategic growth plan and, in order to do so, we continue to focus on three key areas.\\nFirst, driving top-line growth and bottom-line results at our existing properties; second, continuing to build brand awareness; and third, expanding our global footprint.\\nLet me start with our first growth area, driving top- and bottom-line results.\\nOur solid performance in the first quarter, with constant currency adjusted EBITDA more than double than what it was a year ago, is a testament to our focus on driving strong results from our existing portfolio.\\nAs I mentioned on our last call, we modified our organizational structure earlier this year and we did that by changing the reporting lines for all the revenue management and sales related functions to report now into Philippe Cassis.\\nWe made this change in order to break down the silos that previously existed in some of these areas, with the goal of creating one seamless, customer-centric sales organization that encourages the collaboration of all the revenue related efforts at the property, at the regional, as well as on the corporate levels.\\nAlthough we are only making this change just a few months ago, it has already shown the first steps of benefiting to our results, with the first-quarter, constant currency RevPAR showing a growth of 9%, which was exceeding the top end of our guidance range.\\nWe expect that this resource realignment will continue to be an effective approach to drive maximum revenue and in turn obviously EBITDA from our existing portfolio.\\nWe also continue to reinvest in our assets in order to best position our existing properties for continued growth and enhanced value.\\nDuring the first quarter, we invested $11 million in project CapEx, with a focus on EBITDA enhancing projects first of all.\\nOf that amount, we spent approximately $800,000 at the Belmond Villa Sant'Andrea in Sicily, primarily on a project that increases the number of keys at the hotel from 65 to 69.\\nThis project for me is an excellent example of our team finding creative ways to generate revenue from areas where previously we weren't producing any income.\\nWe converted a back of the house space into high-revenue-producing junior suites by relocating the staff changing areas from one part of the main building, which actually had prime sea views, to an adjacent empty building.\\nWe launched these four new suites just earlier this week and we expect that they will prove to be as successful and in-demand as the six junior suites which we added to this property in May 2014.\\nThe total project budget for the four junior suites is approximately $1.6 million, and we are projecting that these new rooms will yield ADRs in excess of EUR800, with an expected payback period of less than four years.\\nAlso during the quarter, we invested at Belmond Charleston Place in South Carolina to convert retail space into a high-end sports pub.\\nThis site is located at the corner of Meeting and Market Street, which is highly valuable real estate in Charleston due to the robust street traffic which you will find here.\\nWe identified a lucrative opportunity to transform the space, which was previously generating minimal rental income, into a restaurant that we expect will provide enhanced financial returns by allowing us to actually capture the existing demand from both the hotel guests, as well as from the local market.\\nWe expect this restaurant will open at the end of May, and the forecasted total budget for this project is approximately $1.4 million.\\nWe are projecting that the new outlet will generate approximately $1 million of incremental revenue and nearly $300,000 of incremental EBITDA at stabilization, with a payback period of approximately five years.\\nThis project is yet another example on how to repurpose existing underutilized space and drive enhanced asset value.\\nDuring the quarter, we continued to reap the benefits of the investments that were made in prior years as well, so notably at the Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town, where we have been renovating a large percentage of the hotel rooms over the past few years and where we refurbished the hotel's meeting and banqueting facilities in 2015.\\nCollectively, these changes have allowed us to be more effective in our group sales efforts during the shoulder and low seasons, both as a result of having more consistent room product as well as having fresher and more-up-to-date conference space.\\nAdditionally, our significant enhanced room product here has also allowed us to drive rate from transient guests during the hotel's peak season, as it did for the first time in the first quarter of 2016.\\nWe have, if we talk about it here, a leadership team that continues to focus aggressively to look at these type of projects, which give us high financial returns across all of our portfolio, and we do that by leveraging the deep operational experience along with the disciplined financial management that we expect to continue to enhance the quality and the value of all of our premium assets while at the same time driving improved top- and bottom-line results.\\nAdditionally, we are highly focused on the opportunities to further capitalize on some of the key operational events that benefit our hotels.\\nAnd here we are talking in August, Rio de Janeiro that will host the 2016 Summer Olympics with many broadcasting and sporting activities going around, including things like beach volleyball, taking place very close to our hotel on the Copacabana Beach.\\nWe view these games as an enormous opportunity to promote the Belmond brand due to the significant increased guest flow that we will have here, both from new guests staying at the hotel as well as from the elevated walk-in traffic that we are expecting here.\\nAnd all of this should drive enhanced awareness first of all for the legendary Belmond Copacabana Palace but obviously as well for the entire Belmond brand.\\nThis provides me then with a nice transition to our second key focus area, which is building brand awareness.\\nWe continue to make progress in expanding the brand reach through select strategic partnerships and by developing our employees' understanding at the same time in understanding and appreciation of the brand and where we are taking it.\\nWe recently enhanced our sales distribution opportunities with the addition of two of our hotels into the Virtuoso network.\\nVirtuoso is a leading luxury travel network that offers by-invitation only memberships, and with the recent addition of the Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons in Oxfordshire in England and soon-to-be-open Belmond Cadogan Hotel in London, nearly all of our hotels, safaris, trains and cruises participate in this exclusive program.\\nAnd, looking a little bit more specifically here at the addition of the Belmond Cadogan, it is in fact rare to have a hotel that is added to the Virtuoso network before the property has actually opened.\\nTypically Virtuoso will observe a hotel's first year of operations prior to deciding whether to include the property in their program.\\nAnd by having the Belmond Cadogan added nearly a year before its opening, we should be able to gain traction from this high-end leisure guest earlier in our sales processes, which is great news.\\nVirtuoso's decision to add Belmond Cadogan is for me a vote of confidence in our brand and it shows that they trust in the quality of the product even before seeing the renovated hotel.\\nIt also is a validation that they believe in the experiences that we offer, and the level of services that we provide, to our guests.\\nThen in April, we hosted our first ever leadership conference, where we brought together our senior team members from across all areas of the organization - both corporate, regional and owned property, to introduce the teams to our strategic plan.\\nThe goal here was to engage with the key members of the Belmond team, and dialogue about the Company, about our strategy and our goals, and I can truly say that the feedback has been that everyone is extremely excited about where the Company is going, and we believe that we are well-positioned for the execution of our growth plan.\\nAt the conference, we also launched our Belmond core values, which we have since begun rolling out across the entire Company.\\nOur core values are the essence of who we are, it's defining our internal culture and it is framing of the relationships that we have with our guests and with our communities.\\nAnd, as I have said before, it is our employees who will truly bring our brand to life in the eyes of the guests and, consequently, it is essential that our employees live and breathe their Belmond brand, and that starts with our core values.\\nThat brings me then to our third area of focus, which is expanding our footprint.\\nEssential to our aggressive footprint expansion plan is having the right resources in the right locations, to be fostering the relationship with - and promoting the Belmond management platform to - the key owners, the developers and the potential partners.\\nAs I have mentioned on our last call, we have been concentrating on recruiting top talent to join our development team, and I am pleased to say that we have recently hired a new development director who joined our team in London here in April.\\nOur new director will be dedicated resource for the European market, with a strong focus on the southern part of the continent.\\nWe will continue to work very hard on finding our next hire, but we are mindful of the fact that it is more important to get the right candidate than it is to get somebody right now.\\nSo, as such, we are not rushing into any decisions but we are clear of our mandate to move quickly.\\nI must again emphasize that we do not expect that the incremental overhead expenses that we are talking about here associated with these new resources to be significant, and, as I just noted, building the right team of qualified people is crucial to getting our development engine going.\\nWe also have continued to foster existing relationships and build new ones with the right players in the development world.\\nIn March, James Simmonds, our Senior Vice President of Global Development, and I, we attended the International Hotel Investment Forum in Berlin, which is the paramount lodging industry and development conference in Europe.\\nAnd just last week we were at the Arabian Hotel Investment Conference in Dubai meeting with some of the Middle East's most important developers and decision-makers.\\nBy having the right people on our team combined with the solid relationships with the key players in the development industry, I believe that we can start gaining ground on our aggressive plans to expand our global footprint.\\nWe look forward to discussing this component, this important component of our growth plan, more fully with you when we meet in June.\\nThen in conclusion, I am pleased with our performance in the first quarter.\\nWe exceeded our RevPAR guidance and we delivered strong year-over-year growth.\\nAnd, although the first quarter is seasonally our least financially significant quarter, I absolutely believe that it's essential to come out of the gate strong and we did just that.\\nWe also generated solid business in the quarter that will help us see year-over-year growth for the full year.\\nAnd although we currently expect that the second quarter may provide a few challenges, we are seeing promising signs for the -- very promising signs for the third quarter, so our overall outlook for the year 2016 remains the same, with a projected RevPAR growth of between 3% and 7%.\\nAt the same time, we are not losing sight of our long-term objectives and, during the quarter, we continued to make some good progress on our strategic plan.\\nAs I have said since I assumed the role of CEO a little over six months ago, my goal here is to be completely transparent and open with the shareholders as possible.\\nAnd for me the June investor meeting will give us, me and the team, a great opportunity to work on that goal and I very much look forward to providing more specifics on our plan in a little bit under a month time from now.\\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Martin to take you through our first-quarter results and our RevPAR guidance.\\nAnd after Martin speaks, we will be happy to answer your questions during a Q-and-A.\\nWith that, Martin.\\nThank you, <UNK>, and good morning, everyone.\\nAnd as <UNK> stated, I will now take you through some detail of our first-quarter results and then I will provide some color on how the rest of the year is shaping up.\\nAnd please note that, unless I state otherwise, all of the figures I will provide will be on a constant currency basis.\\nAs <UNK> noted, we started off 2016 with a solid first-quarter.\\nTotal revenue of $99.1 million was up 9% over the prior year quarter.\\nSame-store owned hotel RevPAR was also up 9%.\\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2016 was $7.9 million, a $5.2 million increase over the first quarter of 2015.\\nAdjusted EBITDA retention for the quarter was a healthy 65%, which led to a 500 basis point year-over-year increase in our adjusted EBITDA margin to 8% for the first quarter of 2016.\\nLooking at our European owned hotels, we grew first-quarter revenue by 21% and improved adjusted EBITDA by 17% over the prior year quarter.\\nYear-over-year growth in the quarter was largely driven by Belmond Reid's Palace, Madeira, which continued to benefit from increased demand for the destination due in part to increased airlift as well as disruption to North African tourism destinations.\\nOur performance for our European hotels was also helped by the timing of Easter, which took place in the first quarter of 2016 versus the second quarter of 2015 and provided a boost to Belmond Hotel Cipriani, in Venice, in particular.\\nNorth American revenue was down 3% and adjusted EBITDA was down 6%.\\nIn the first quarter of 2015, Belmond El Encanto, in Santa Barbara, had a large buy-out that generated revenue of approximately $700,000, and this business did not re-occur in the current year quarter.\\nBelmond Maroma in Riviera Maya, Mexico was also down slightly and that is partially due to hotels in the Los Cabos region being open with renovated product in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to many hotels being closed in the first quarter of 2015.\\nIn our rest of world region, revenue increased 18% and adjusted EBITDA increased 24% over the prior-year quarter.\\nOur strongest performing hotels were our two in Brazil and also Belmond Mount Nelson in Cape Town.\\nBoth destinations continue to benefit from weaker currencies making the locations more attractive to overseas guests, and we deployed effective yield management techniques to maximize revenue.\\nMount Nelson also benefited from the investments we made in previous years that <UNK> discussed.\\nOur owned trains and cruises segment experienced a 13% revenue decrease from the prior year quarter with adjusted EBITDA declining 35%.\\nThree of our seven products saw EBITDA growth this year in the trains and cruises segment, but the overall result was impacted by year-over-year decreases for our two boats in Myanmar where there are now seven luxury cruise boats operating in the market, as compared to three luxury cruise boats at the beginning of 2015.\\nOn the other hand, we grew adjusted EBITDA for our part-owned and managed trains segment by $1.8 million over the prior year quarter and that was primarily due to the performance of PeruRail.\\nAfter year-over-year savings in central costs, our total adjusted EBITDA was up $5.2 million.\\nNow, turning to our balance sheet at March 31, 2016, we had total debt of $590 million.\\nTotal cash, including restricted cash, was $128 million, resulting in total net debt of $462 million and net leverage of 3.8 times.\\nNote that the euro balance sheet rate at the end of the quarter was 5% stronger than at year-end, increasing the dollar value of our debt by $7.7 million.\\nOur $105 million corporate revolver, remains undrawn, so, including the revolver, but excluding restricted cash, our total cash availability was $226 million at the end of the first quarter.\\nOur fixed to floating interest split was 51% fixed to 49% floating.\\nOur weighted average interest rate was 4.3% and our weighted average debt maturity was 4.8 years.\\nNow, turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2016.\\nOur constant currency guidance for the same-store -- for same-store worldwide RevPAR growth for the second quarter of 2016 is negative 1% to positive 3%, with growth coming mostly from occupancy.\\nOverall, the tone for the quarter is steady.\\nAs you can see from our guidance, we do not currently expect to have RevPAR growth as strong as we saw in the first quarter.\\nNote that our expectations for the second quarter are consistent with what we had been expecting when we first provided 2016 guidance earlier this year.\\nWe are expecting a stronger third quarter, which you will appreciate better when I turn to the full-year guidance.\\nIn the second quarter, we expect to have increased RevPAR at eight out of 10 hotels in our European segment.\\nThis growth is being partially offset by a non-Biennale year at Belmond Hotel Cipriani, in Venice.\\nAt Belmond Grand Hotel Europe, in St.\\nPetersburg, we continue to market successfully to non-traditional markets, and we are currently expecting a healthy uplift in occupancy for the second quarter.\\nDespite the increased occupancy, we expect RevPAR to fall, as, in the prior year quarter, we had a foreign delegation during the annual economic forum that purchased a block of rooms at a high rate, and that particular group is not expected to return this year.\\nIn North America, we expect that Belmond Charleston Place, for which the second quarter is its seasonally highest revenue quarter, will deliver a healthy result helped by enhanced room product following the recent completion of our phased rooms renovation.\\nWe expect that Belmond El Encanto will return to its growth trajectory in the second quarter, as the hotel continues to mature.\\nWe expect that the RevPAR increases at both of these hotels will be partially offset by a RevPAR decline at Belmond Maroma.\\nIn our rest of world region, our resorts will be impacted primarily by Brazil, which is hosting the Olympics in the third quarter.\\nWe are anticipating a bit of a lull in demand leading up to the games, so we expect that RevPAR for our two hotels in Brazil will be flattish for the second quarter.\\nWe do expect to see some healthy RevPAR growth at Belmond Mount Nelson, in Cape Town, which we expect will continue to benefit from our recent investments in the hotel's rooms and meeting and banqueting facilities.\\nSo when you look at all the regions combined, what we are expecting to see is same-store worldwide RevPAR growth in the second quarter of negative 1% to positive 3%.\\nOur same-store US dollar RevPAR guidance range for the second quarter is between negative 4% and 0%.\\nThis divergence from our constant currency guidance is being driven primarily by forecasted weaker year-to-date average rateS for the Brazilian real and Russian rouble as compared to the same period in 2015.\\nSo, turning to the full-year 2016, we are maintaining our constant currency guidance for same-store worldwide RevPAR growth at 3% to 7%.\\nIn total, we expect growth to come from both rate and occupancy, but driven slightly more by rate.\\nWe are expecting an overall moderate increase in RevPAR for our European segment, which is being driven by a firm third quarter, particularly in Italy.\\nWhile the euro has strengthened a bit this year, it remains at low levels compared to where it has historically traded, making European destinations still very attractive to visitors from North America, our largest customer base.\\nIn Europe, we are forecasting that our strongest RevPAR increases will be at Belmond Villa Sant'Andrea in Sicily, which we expect will benefit from the four new junior suites we opened earlier this week; at Belmond La Residencia in Mallorca, where our percentage of US clients has been steadily increasing over the last few years following targeted marketing efforts; and Belmond Reid's Palace, which is having a strong year due to better air access and continued displacement from North African markets.\\nIn our North America segment, the full-year picture is being driven by expected RevPAR growth at Belmond Charleston Place and Belmond El Encanto.\\nWe have been very satisfied with the progress of Belmond Charleston Place as a result of our three-year rooms refurbishment, and, as <UNK> mentioned, we are continuing to invest to drive incremental EBITDA from this property.\\nWe are currently expecting a similar rate of growth at Belmond El Encanto.\\nRevPAR growth for the region is expected to be partially offset by the factors affecting Maroma's performance that I touched on earlier.\\nWe anticipate that our strongest RevPAR growth for the full year will come from our rest of world segment.\\nThis is of course being driven by the Olympic Games taking place in Rio, which we currently anticipate will help deliver a net adjusted EBITDA benefit in the third quarter of approximately $4 million for Belmond Copacabana Palace.\\nThat said, due to an expected lull in demand pre- and post-Olympics, we anticipate an overall uplift in the hotel's adjusted EBITDA for the full year of approximately $3 million.\\nSo again, when we look at all the regions combined, we are anticipating full-year 2016 same-store worldwide RevPAR growth of 3% to 7%.\\nAnd our same-store US dollar RevPAR guidance range for the full year is between 0% and 4%.\\nAnd this divergence from our constant currency guidance is being driven primarily by a projected weaker Brazilian real and rouble and the South African rand when comparing our forecasted rates to the averages for the full-year of 2015.\\nBut looking at the impact of currency and EBITDA for the full year of 2016, we are currently projecting that US dollar adjusted EBITDA growth will be negatively impacted by a total of approximately $1.5 million to $2.5 million as a result of all of the year-over-year currency movements.\\nAnd this compares favorably to 2015 when we experienced a negative currency impact of nearly $20 million, with the main driver last year of being the year-over-year depreciation of the euro.\\nIt was down 16%.\\nAnd the year-over-year depreciation of the real, that was down 30%.\\nSo for 2016, our forecast is currently showing that the euro would be relatively flat compared to the prior year and the real will also be down but less so than we experienced for 2015.\\nSo, as you can see, we are currently expecting much lighter FX headwinds than we experienced last year.\\nSo that concludes our prepared remarks and before I hand you back to the operator for Q&A, we would like to request that you limit your questions asked to two per person.\\nSo thanks very much.\\nOperator.\\nHi, <UNK>, this is <UNK>.\\nI think I can give you an indication of what we see in the third quarter.\\nWe have seen booking pace pretty much ahead of last year from a pace point of view.\\nIf we look at what the third quarter is driving, it is up nearly all of our hotels in Italy, which are up in material numbers from an occupancy point of view.\\nBoth in rate and occupancy we see actually the upsides and if we take that then further, it would apply to both transient as well as groups.\\nSo overall, the picture for both the third quarter and the entire year as Martin already said looks extremely good and solid.\\nI think what we'll be seeing there is probably half rate, half occupancy, so you are not going to have -- obviously if it was all rate, there would be much higher flow through but there will be picking up in occupancy as well.\\nI think if you look at the overall results for the full year, we are still very pleased with the growth that we are expecting to see from that hotel.\\nIt just continues to outperform our expectations year over year over year, which is why we continue to invest in what is a very successful property.\\nI would have to get back to you what we were saying back then.\\nBut right now what we are saying for the full-year, Joe, is the overall currency impacts I think we said was about $1.5 million to $2.5 million.\\nI would have to track back in my notes to see what it was back then.\\nI think that if we talk about the share repurchase when making decisions on how and when we would repurchase our shares, we would be looking at that in the form of how to best deliver long-term value to our shareholders.\\nI think at this point in time we do have a great vision of where we are taking the Company and we believe that the successful execution of our growth plan will actually deliver great and greater long-term shareholder value at this point in time.\\nAnd we would be more than happy to talk to you about that when we get together in June.\\nWell, for as far as putting the team together as I mentioned already, we have been putting a lot of effort on that and I was very pleased to be able to hire from one of our competitors one of their directors away who has started in April with us and actually hit the ground running.\\nTogether with James, James Simmonds, our Senior Vice President of Development, we have been talking to a lot of decision-makers in the field.\\nWe are building up our lead pipeline.\\nI think it would be not correct to talk about the pipeline of LOIs and the like but we start seeing some good build up here of things that potentially could be converted into contracts over time.\\nSo it is early days but we are building up and we will continue to search for the other candidates as I had mentioned for those areas where we think that we have the biggest chance of success if we provide them with the resources to go after these deals.\\nAnd we will keep you posted as we go along.\\nWell, I am more than happy to pass that on to Martin for as far as the details of the other directors would be concerned.\\nBut for as far as myself is concerned, I can tell you that at the moment that I had the opportunity after joining this Company, the opportunity when the window opens from our blackout period, I was in the position to buy shares and I can say that I bought 50,000 shares in the month of November.\\nAnd it was with private money, with after-tax money.\\nSo just to reconfirm my vision of where we can take this Company and what kind of an investment I see in there.\\nYes, and I am not going to comment on the specifics of individual director purchases but you will see the full list of directors and their individual ownership in the proxy that was recently filed.\\nClearly you will see from the table that both the directors and management have a significant equity interest in the business.\\nOkay, thanks for that, <UNK>.\\nAnd the kind of relation that you would have with an organization like Virtuoso, they have a very large number of agents that are linked into Virtuoso and they pride themselves on being on the absolute top-end of the market.\\nThese are the kind of customers that are used to paying the very high rates to stay with us both in the high season as well as in the mid- and lower-seasons.\\nSo for us for nearly all of our properties, these would be important -- this would be an important customer relations.\\nAnd to be accepted in there, you have to prove to the Virtuoso organization that actually you can live up to the guest expectations that they are portraying out to their customers.\\nSo it is truly a very important relation.\\nIt is not an exclusive thing.\\nThere is different players in the market but Virtuoso is I would say one of the key players in here and that is why we are thrilled to get them on board for both the Cadogan as well as for the Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons.\\nAnd, yes, they do also help us a lot in the lower and the off-seasons so this is something that we could push hard on and making sure that with our sales organization we stay very close to our customers.\\nYes, there is a cost involved in participating as a member of Virtuoso.\\nI would not be able to tell you what the exact amounts are.\\nBut you can consider the commission cost as normal as would be in a normal agency situation, whereas the participation cost in the membership I would have to check that back.\\nBut I would not see that as material in the overall relation of the business they would drive to us.\\nThank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you at our analyst meeting in a few weeks.\\nHave a great day.\\nThanks everybody.\\nThank you.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n
